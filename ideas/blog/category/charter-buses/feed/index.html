				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re part of a <a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/school-event-bus-rental">university LGBTQ+ group</a> or a <a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/private-bus-transportation">community nonprofit</a>, you’ll never forget your first visit to San Francisco. It’s difficult to overstate the Castro’s importance as one of the first large gayborhoods and a place of support and community during the AIDS crisis. When you take your group to visit, you’ll be surrounded by reminders of the challenges the queer community has faced and still faces, but you’ll also be surrounded by reminders of the community’s strength, vitality, and joy.</p>
<p>A charter bus offers an easy way to explore all of <a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/">San Francisco</a>, from the Castro District to SoMA (South of Market, another neighborhood with many LGBTQ+ hotspots). You can keep your entire group together and even request TVs to watch <em>Looking </em>or <em>The L Word </em>sequel. When you’re ready to plan a group trip to SF, give San Francisco Charter Bus Company a call at <strong>415-404-6456</strong>. We’d love to help your group explore the city.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-204" src="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/The-Castro.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="503" srcset="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/The-Castro.jpg 750w, https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/The-Castro-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<h2>Historical Landmarks</h2>
<p>You can’t go to SF with an LGBTQ+ group without visiting its many historical sites. Most of these important locations lie within the Castro, so you can ask your <a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/buses">charter bus</a> to drop you off and then your group can wander to each one on foot. Want to go somewhere that’s not within the Castro district? Your driver will pick up your group and take you straight to your destination.</p>
<h3>Alice B. Toklas LGBT Democratic Club</h3>
<p>Named for the influential writer who was also Gertrude Stein’s life partner, the Alice B. Toklas Club began in 1971 and was the first political club formed specifically for queer people. The organization backed important LGBTQ+ leaders like Harvey Milk, Mark Leno and Dianne Feinstein, and although it now has competition from other LGBT political organizations, its historical building in the Castro is still worth a visit.</p>
<p>Address:  518 Valencia St, San Francisco, CA 94110</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-205" src="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/The-Castro-2.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/The-Castro-2.jpg 750w, https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/The-Castro-2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<h3>Castro Camera</h3>
<p>Harvey Milk ran Castro Camera from 1972 to 1978 and lived above the store from 1975 until his death. During that time, it was a gathering place for the LGBTQ+ community and a center for his political campaigns. It’s now a historical landmark as well as an action center and store for the Human Rights Campaign. If your group wants to learn more about the building’s history, you can go inside and ask the HRC store employees any questions you have.</p>
<p>Address: 575 Castro St, San Francisco, CA 94114</p>
<h3>The Castro Theatre</h3>
<p>You haven’t truly seen the Castro until you’ve stopped by The Castro Theatre. First opened in 1922, this historic theater now showcases a diverse array of shows, including drag performances, movie sing-a-longs, and screenings of cult classics. The theater also hosts the San Francisco International LGBTQ Film Festival each year. The best part? They have an organist who plays music before the movies begin!</p>
<p>Address: 429 Castro St, San Francisco, CA 94114</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-206" src="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Castro-Theater.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Castro-Theater.jpg 750w, https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Castro-Theater-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<h3>GLBT Historical Society Museum</h3>
<p>Nicknamed “the queer Smithsonian,” the GLBT Historical Society Museum was the first stand-alone museum in the U.S dedicated to queer culture. Although the museum is small, it contains photos, publications, audio recordings, letters, and clothing covering the lives of LGBTQ+ people from the founding of SF to the present.</p>
<p>The GLBT Historical Society has an abundance of material focusing on well-known local heroes like Harvey Milk. But the society also makes a concentrated effort to include the contributions of people who have not received the recognition they deserve, like queer women, trans people, and people of color. If you’re part of an <a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/corporate-bus-rental">LGBTQ+-oriented business or nonprofit</a>, this is an essential stop.</p>
<p>Address: 4127 18th St, San Francisco, CA 94114</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-207" src="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Lesbian-couple-park.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Lesbian-couple-park.jpg 750w, https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Lesbian-couple-park-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<h3>Hartford Street Zen Center</h3>
<p>Former drag queen Isaan Dorsey opened the Hartford Street Zen Center in 1981 to serve queer people practicing Buddhism and later established the Maitri Hospice, the first Buddhist hospice for people battling AIDS. He helped care for hundreds of people before succumbing to the disease himself in 1990.</p>
<p>The Zen Center used to be one of the few places people with AIDS could receive compassionate care. Though the building no longer serves as a hospice, it remains a welcoming Buddhist temple where people of all gender identities and sexualities can gather for prayer and meditation.</p>
<p>Address: 57 Hartford St, San Francisco, CA 94114</p>
<h3>Mission Dolores Park</h3>
<p>Since this public park lies walking distance from The Castro Theatre, it’s become a popular gathering place for queer locals and tourists. It’s also a great place to have a picnic with your group if you packed your own lunches or to play a round of soccer if you’re traveling with <a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/sports-team-bus-rental">athletes</a>. In the summer, you might see queer people in swimwear gathering to sunbathe on the park’s top rim, affectionately nicknamed “the Fruit Shelf.”</p>
<p>Address: Dolores St &amp; 19th St, San Francisco, CA 94114</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-208" src="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Mission-Dolores-Park.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Mission-Dolores-Park.jpg 750w, https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Mission-Dolores-Park-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<h3>Pink Triangle Park and Memorial</h3>
<p>The Castro houses the U.S.’s only free-standing monument dedicated to LGBTQ+ victims of the Holocaust. Robert Bruce and Susan Martin designed this memorial that opened in 2001 and features 15 granite pillars, each engraved with the names of 1,000 people who were killed in concentration camps. Although this is a difficult site to visit, it’s undeniably an important one.</p>
<p>Address: 2454 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94114</p>
<h3>National AIDS Memorial Grove</h3>
<p>The National AIDS Memorial Grove lies in Golden Gate Park, so you’ll need to take <a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/56-passenger-charter-bus-rental">your bus</a> there from the Castro. But it would be a mistake to leave San Francisco without stopping to pay your respects at this solemnly beautiful memorial. Rather than building a large artificial structure, San Francisco decided to remember the many lives lost to AIDS by planting a grove of beautiful trees. Small stone markers engraved with the names of victims lie throughout the grove so you can pause and reflect as you walk by.</p>
<p>Address: Nancy Pelosi Drive &amp; Bowling Green Dr, San Francisco, CA 94122</p>
<h3>San Francisco City Hall</h3>
<p>This striking Beaux-Arts building is worth visiting on any group trip, but City Hall is also a site of both sorrowful and joyful moments in LGBTQ+ history. Dan White assassinated Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk there in 1978. Roughly 25 years later, City Hall hosted the first same-sex weddings in San Francisco after the mayor ordered the city to begin issuing marriage licenses to couples of all genders in 2004.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-209" src="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SF-City-Hall.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SF-City-Hall.jpg 750w, https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SF-City-Hall-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p>Although those early marriages were voided by the courts, queer couples are now free to apply for their marriage licenses at San Francisco City Hall, and you can still find <a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/wedding-bus-rental">people getting married</a> here. If you’re lucky enough to visit <a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/blog/guide-to-visiting-san-francisco-pride/">during Pride</a>, you’ll even see the building light up in rainbow colors.</p>
<p>Address: 1 Dr Carlton B Goodlett Pl, San Francisco, CA 94102</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silicon Valley is synonymous with tech start-ups and giants constantly changing the way we work, live, and communicate. From Facebook and Tesla to Google and Netflix, it’s no wonder tourists flock to the work campuses of these household names to see exactly where the magic happens. However, many tech companies don’t allow public visits to their headquarters (they’re busy getting work done after all!)—but don’t let this stop you from exploring San Francisco’s tech scene. There are still plenty of destinations you can go to fill your day and see into the lives of the city’s biggest and brightest minds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re planning a group visit to the Bay Area, San Francisco Charter Bus Company can pair you with the </span><a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/buses"><span style="font-weight: 400;">motorcoach or minibus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you need to visit every spot on this list and more. Use this guide to map out a private hop-on hop-off charter bus tour of the most visitor-friendly technology companies in the city.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the actual Apple campus is closed to the public, the </span><a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/appleparkvisitorcenter/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple Park Visitor Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a fascinating place to explore. The building itself is praised for its unique, modern architecture  and houses a cafe, a store, and immersive experiences. Explore a 3-D model of the campus using virtual reality, shop from a selection of location-exclusive Apple products and branded merchandise, or stroll the rooftop terrace and see the sprawling Apple Park grounds from new heights. Plan your visit around one of the many </span><a href="https://www.apple.com/today/appleparkvisitorcenter/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">free Skills sessions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where experts teach you techniques and tools for photography, video, coding, apps and more with Apple products.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intel Museum</span></h2>
<p><b>Address</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Robert Noyce Building, 2200 Mission College Blvd. Santa Clara, CA 95054</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The interactive </span><a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/company-overview/intel-museum.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intel Museum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Intel HQ started in the early 1980s and is now open to the public with free admission. Visitors get to see what it’s like inside an automated silicon chip factory and learn how Intel produces micro-miniature computer chips. The process for creating silicon chips requires air cleaner than is found in hospital operating rooms, so Intel manufacturers work in ultraclean, purified environments and wear special gear called “bunny suits.” At the “Intel Fab” exhibit area, visitors can watch them in action via a flat-screen TV and even try on a “bunny suit” for themselves. To </span><a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/history/museum-visiting-intel.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">schedule a group tour</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can call 408-765-5050 or email museum@intel.com and make an advance reservation. Note that the minimum size for a group is 8 people and the maximum is 20.</span></p>

There are no official public tours here, but you’re allowed to freely walk around the 12-acre campus and soak in the sights. Make sure to snap a few pictures at the Android Sculpture Garden: a lawn spotted with candy-colored robots representing every new Android operating system. Next door, at 1981 Landings Drive, is the Google Merchandise Store,  where you can stock up on Google-branded goodies like apparel, phone accessories and water bottles.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Computer History Museum</span></h2>
<p><b>Address</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: 1401 N. Shoreline Blvd, Mountain View, CA 94043</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just outside the Google Campus you’ll find the </span><a href="https://computerhistory.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Computer History Museum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a fascinating look into the evolution of technology. The permanent exhibition </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revolution: The First 2000 Years of Computing </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">walks guests through the history of computer science “from the abacus to the smartphone.” You’ll see modern artifacts like the Apple-1 computer (created  in 1976 and signed by Steve Wozniak) and an Atari Pong Prototype, one of the first video gaming systems.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://computerhistory.org/adult-learners-tours/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Group reservations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> need to be made at least 8 weeks in advance for docent-led tours through the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revolution</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> exhibit. If you’re more interested in a self-guided tour, groups can make a reservation 2 weeks in advance. You can also ask about special programs like workshops and lectures for adult learners or a one-hour scavenger hunt tour through the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revolution</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> exhibit. (Groups also receive a 10% discount to use at the museum and cafe!)</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce Tower</span></h2>
<p><b>Address</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: 415 Mission St, San Francisco, CA 94105</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Climb to the top of the tech world with a community tour at Salesforce Tower, the tallest skyscraper in San Francisco and the headquarters for the cloud-based CRM platform. Tours take you to the 61st floor of the tower, known as the Ohana Floor, a two-story space with a kitchen, bars, and conference rooms where Salesforce employees decompress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it should come as no surprise that these tours are extremely popular—they are sold out months in advance and don’t formally accommodate group requests. The tower  offers four one-hour tours a day with up to five people per party, so if you want to book a group you’ll need to plan around these parameters.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you’re visiting <a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/">San Francisco</a> or you live in the Bay Area, one thing’s for sure: spring and summer are great times to be in the city. In the spring, the weather is mild and clear, and it’s off-season for the tourists. Summer sees an influx of tourists, but longer days mean you have time to see everything on your bucket list.</p>
<p>It won’t be hard to find something fun to do with the plethora of outdoor events to attend in the Bay Area between the months of March and September. To help you and your group plan the perfect itinerary in San Francisco, our team at San Francisco Charter Bus Company have come up with a list of our favorite, can&#8217;t-miss events in the area.</p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> The <a href="https://sffilm.org/">San Francisco International Film Festival</a> is the longest-running film festival in the Americas.

<p><strong>Bus Tip:</strong> Want to pregame before the film festival? Keep the party going all the way to there by opting for a shared ride experience with San Francisco Charter Bus Company. The <a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/buses">charter buses</a> in our network can carry anywhere from 18-56 people. In most cases, you can even drink on the bus on the way there—just clarify with our reservation specialists ahead of time that you’d like to bring alcohol.</p>
<h2>San Francisco International Beer Festival</h2>
<p><strong>What:</strong> The <a href="https://www.sfbeerfest.com/">San Francisco International Beer Festival</a> is the Bay Area’s oldest beer festival with over 100 brewers, live music, complementary bites, games, and (of course) great-tasting beer.</p>

<p><strong>Insider Tip:</strong> People who <a href="https://www.sfbeerfest.com/volunteer">volunteer</a> at the event will not only feel great about supporting kids in the community, but they’ll also get a T-shirt and their first beverage at the after-party for free.</p>
<p><strong>Bus Tip:</strong> Let’s face it… after drinking for three hours, you might have a little trouble getting home trying to call an Uber or taking public transportation. Leave the group travel logistics up to San Francisco Charter Bus Company! We can take you and your friends there and back home, so all you have to worry about is having fun.</p>

<p><strong>Bus Tip:</strong> Due to lack of parking options, it is not recommended to drive your own car to the event. Taking a charter bus with your group will help you arrive relaxed and ready to celebrate. Your driver will take care of all of the details, so you can sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride to Carnaval San Francisco.</p>
<h2>Clusterfest Comedy Festival</h2>
<p><strong>What:</strong> Comedy, podcasts and drag queens&#8230;oh my! Are you and your crew ready to have a night you won’t forget? Then <a href="https://www.clusterfest.com/">Clusterfest</a> is the event for you. Taking place over the course of a three-day weekend, you’ll be entertained by more than 50 acts on five stages celebrating all things comedy.</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong> Civic Center Plaza, 335 McAllister St, San Francisco, CA 94102 and the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium, 99 Grove St, San Francisco, CA 94102</p>

<p><strong>Bus Tip:</strong> Parking in the area is tough, and if you’re attending the comedy festival with a group of your closest friends or extended family, why worry about coordinating multiple Ubers? With a charter bus, you’ll all be able to arrive at the same time and walk in together.</p>

<p><strong>Insider Tip:</strong> You can buy a <a href="https://www.sfoutsidelands.com/news/refillable-beer-cups/">refillable beer cup</a> while at the festival to save on single-use plastic for $6.</p>
<p><strong>Bus Tip:</strong> Outside Lands recommends rideshares, scooters or bikes to get to Golden Gate Park due to limited parking.

<h2>About San Francisco Pride</h2>
<p>The San Francisco Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Pride Celebration is an exciting annual event that, according to the <u><a href="http://www.sfpride.org/about/">official SF Pride website</a></u>, aims to “educate the world, commemorate our heritage, celebrate our culture, and liberate our people.” Each June, the celebration marks the end of the month-long Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month, held each year to honor the 1969 Stonewall riots in Manhattan, which were a crucial tipping point for the nation’s Gay Liberation Movement.</p>
<p>The 2-day celebration is highlighted with inspirational speakers and performers from around the world, but perhaps the best-known highlight of the event is the annual Pride Parade, one of the world’s oldest and largest LGBTQIA parades.</p>
<p>Whether you’re just stopping by for the parade or you’re planning a weekend trip to experience all of the Pride’s top events, we’ve put together some travel tips to help you make the most of your trip!</p>
<h2>Where to Stay</h2>

<h2>Where to Go</h2>
<h3>For the Celebration &amp; Rally:</h3>
<p>Many performing acts and inspirational speakers will appear at the Main Stage, which is located at the steps of City Hall in Civic Center Plaza.</p>
<h3><strong>San Francisco City Hall</strong></h3>
<p>Address: 1 Dr Carlton B Goodlett Place, San Francisco, CA 94102</p>
<p>Community stages and other gathering spaces will be spread throughout the area near City Hall. Spaces include designated areas for Deaf and Hard-of-hearing visitors, a Women’s stage, an Asian &amp; Pacific Islander community stage and pavilion, as well as other areas for various groups to engage with one another. Be sure to check the <u><a href="http://www.sfpride.org/stages/">full list of community stages</a></u> to help plan where you’d like to go during the celebration.</p>
<p>Festivities are held on the last Saturday and Sunday of June. Saturday’s events run from 12:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. while Sunday’s events run from 11:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>For the Parade:</h3>
<p>The San Francisco Pride Parade marches down Market Street from Embarcadero to the Civic Center. A <u><a href="http://www.sfpride.org/parade/">map</a></u> can be found on the Pride website to help visitors navigate their way to the parade route.</p>
<p>The parade is set to begin on day 2 of the celebration (the last Sunday in June) at 10:30 a.m. Expect at least 200 contingents to participate in the parade, which can sometimes continue until 3:00 in the afternoon.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-155 aligncenter" src="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/san-francisco-pride-parade.jpg" alt="supporters cheer during a san francisco pride rally" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/san-francisco-pride-parade.jpg 750w, https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/san-francisco-pride-parade-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<h2>What to Bring</h2>
<p>While attendees are discouraged from bringing bags, some essentials may be necessary in order to make the most of your Pride experience! Remember to pack these items, whether you’ll be bringing along a bag or just using your pockets. Note that, if you do decide to bring a bag to the festivities, it cannot be larger than 18 square inches.</p>
<p><strong>Sunglasses:</strong> San Francisco is known for its hot, sunny weather. Since you’ll be outside for most of the celebration, be sure to bring along some shades.</p>
<p><strong>Sunscreen:</strong> We repeat: it’s going to be hot and very sunny while you’re in town! Protect your skin with sunscreen, and remember to reapply every few hours.</p>
<p><strong>Water:</strong> Stay hydrated to ensure that you feel your best throughout the celebration. Bring along a bottle of water or a refillable bottle to help make sure you’re drinking enough water.</p>
<p><strong>Backup phone charger:</strong> Keep your phone charged to stay current on festival updates and to help you coordinate plans with your group. A backup charger will ensure that you won’t have to be hyper-aware of your phone’s battery status all day.</p>
<h2>How to Get Around</h2>
<p>While we charter <u><a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/buses">both full-sized coaches and minibuses</a></u>, a minibus is typically a better option for city travel. This is especially true for Pride weekend, when extra crowds will be traveling on foot through San Francisco’s busy streets. We offer <u><a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/18-passenger-minibus-rental">18-</a></u>, <u><a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/20-passenger-minibus-rental">20-</a></u>, and <u><a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/25-passenger-minibus-rental">25-passenger minibus</a></u> models, all of which can be customized to your group’s particular requests. Air conditioning and reclining seats make for a comfortable ride to and from the Pride festivities, and WiFi and power outlets make it easy to stay connected while you travel.</p>
<p>Unlike public transportation or rideshare services, a private minibus allows your group to travel as a unit through San Francisco, ensuring that no one ends up lost along the way. Set your own pickup and dropoff times and let your driver handle all navigation&#8211; all you have to do is relax, enjoy the ride, and focus on having an unforgettable Pride experience.</p>

We’ll guide you through our simple booking process for events of every kind, allowing trip planners to quickly rent buses for <u><a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/private-bus-transportation">private outings</a></u>, <u><a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/corporate-bus-rental">corporate events</a></u>, <u><a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/wedding-bus-rental">wedding celebrations</a></u>, <u><a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/school-event-bus-rental">school field trips</a></u>, and more. Take to the streets on your schedule!</p>
<h2>How to Get Around the Bay Area By Bus</h2>
<p>When you’re traveling through golden attractions and over bridges, consider taking a private shuttle instead of Uber or Lyft. Your driver can take you to any sites and attractions in or outside of the city, making you only a ride away from the most breathtaking views of the Bay. Though trains, subways, buses, ferries, and railways are also functional for short direct trips, they are not the quickest travel solution due to their long lines and unpredictable travel schedules. If you are arriving in a nearby city and plan to make your way to the Bay on your next trip to San Francisco, we recommend you take a <u><a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/buses">San Francisco charter bus</a></u> through the best routes in town. A private bus can whisk your group to top travel destinations with ease, while you relax and enjoy every step of the way through California’s most beloved port city.</p>
<h2>Travel Comfortably to Outdoor Activities in the Bay</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-138" src="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/social-media-vacation.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="350" srcset="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/social-media-vacation.jpg 750w, https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/social-media-vacation-300x140.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p>The most important step in planning your trip is choosing the right bus model for you. Outdoor trips can take weeks, sometimes months on the road before arriving at your destination, so ensure you’ll be traveling comfortably on your journey. For smaller groups, we offer a wide selection of <u><a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/20-passenger-minibus-rental">minibus models</a></u> holding up to <u><a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/25-passenger-minibus-rental">25 passengers</a></u>. The<u><a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/56-passenger-charter-bus-rental"> 56-passenger</a></u> model, however, is our most-used charter bus for larger groups of students and volunteers due to its spaciousness.</p>
<p>If you’re traveling for more than a few days, we recommend investing in a full-sized coach. Each model can come with modern luxury features such as climate-controlled interiors, cushioned reclining seats, overhead storage, and luggage bays beneath the bus. If you’re traveling for business or school, you’ll want to use our on-board WiFi, power outlets, and flat-screen TVs with DVD players to keep passengers entertained as they bond along the way. Whether you’re planning an all-day shuttle service or a week-long road trip to a neighboring town, comfortable amenities make it easy to keep your group comfortable and relaxed as you travel together. We’ll make sure you’re paired with a reliable ride to make the event run smoothly!</p>

<p><u><a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/">San Francisco</a></u>, California has its fair share of spellbinding views, historic churches, wineries, and vineyards perfect for an adventurous bride and groom. The City by the Bay is home to the largest collection of American wines in the world, so it’s no surprise that couples line up to plan their dream wedding at one of its enchanting sites, vineyards, and wineries. While a wedding venue unites two members in a loving partnership, it also welcomes and brings together families big and small along with the extended community. Traveling with large parties can present many challenges that make staying together a chore. To avoid the airport and public transit hassles, make sure you choose a <u><a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/buses">wedding shuttle</a></u> equipped to accommodate your entire party from pickup at the hotel to drop off at the venue.</p>

<h2>Ride in Style to Top Venues for Your Big Day</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-128" src="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/san-fran-wedding-decor-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="350" srcset="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/san-fran-wedding-decor-1-1.jpg 750w, https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/san-fran-wedding-decor-1-1-300x140.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p>SF Charter Bus Company will help organize the ceremony with elegant transportation, so you can focus on what’s important: your special day. From the bachelorette and bachelor party to the wedding ceremony and reception, San Francisco Charter Bus Company will give you one less item for a planner to worry about. We can pair you with a sleek and modern full-sized coach rental for the wedding ceremony and reception, or even a minibus to transport smaller groups around town for the bachelor or bachelorette party. Each wedding shuttle can also be decorated to match the theme of your wedding, making the trip more personalized for your guests. If your group plans to wine and dine as they venue hop, your driver can double as a designated driver so everyone in your bachelor or bachelorette trip will be worry-free!</p>
<p>There are a few types of wedding shuttles to choose from, which include an <u><a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/18-passenger-minibus-rental">18-passenger</a></u> minibus, <u><a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/20-passenger-minibus-rental">20-passenger</a></u> minibus, or a <u><a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/56-passenger-charter-bus-rental">56-passenger</a></u> charter bus. When traveling with a small group of fewer than 25 guests, your best option may be to invest in a minibus rental so that you are not left with more seats than people. For a large wedding party of 25 to 56 passengers, you may want to rent a full-sized charter bus to get more seats at a more affordable rate.</p>

<p>Planning a group trip into San Francisco? A charter bus is a great way to get around, but before you call and book your bus, you’ll want to know how much you can expect to pay.</p>
<p>Many factors will determine the cost of your rental, including the type of bus you need, how long you’ll need it for, and when your trip takes place, among others. Keep reading below to learn more about how your bus rental cost is calculated!</p>
<p>This chart will help to determine a baseline cost of our most popular bus models:</p>

<h2>How We Calculate Your Cost</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trip Date:</strong> Peak season for motorcoach rentals usually spans from <strong>April to June</strong>, due to increased demand from school events like graduations, dances, and class trips. If you’re booking a bus for a popular San Francisco event, such as the annual <a href="https://www.sresproductions.com/events/st-patricks-day-festival/"> St. Patrick’s Day Parade</a>, that may also increase your price due to higher demand.</li>
<li><strong>Number of Passengers:</strong> More passengers will necessitate a larger bus, which will increase the overall price of your rental. If your group is on the smaller side, opting for a <a href="http://lacharterbuscompany.com/18-passenger-minibus-rental">minibus</a> rather than a <a href="http://lacharterbuscompany.com/56-passenger-charter-bus-rental">full-sized charter bus</a> may save up to $300.</li>
<li><strong>Distance: </strong>Your overall distance traveled will affect not only your final rate but also how your rate is calculated. Short trips are typically priced per hour (with a 5-hour minimum), while long-distance trips are more likely to be priced by the day or by the mile.</li>
<li><strong>Miscellaneous Costs:</strong> Remember to account for small costs that will accrue along the way, such as tolls, parking permits, and a hotel for your driver (if your trip will be spanning multiple days). If you do need to book a hotel for your driver, we recommend choosing one with at least a 3-star rating to ensure that they are well-rested and ready to drive.</li>
</ul>
<p>These factors can help to give you an estimate of what your trip will cost. To get an even better idea of what to expect, check out a few examples below, based on trips that San Francisco Charter Bus Company has booked in the past:</p>
<h2>Business Trips</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-79" src="http://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/san-francisco-charter-bus-business-trip-price.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="350" srcset="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/san-francisco-charter-bus-business-trip-price.jpg 750w, https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/san-francisco-charter-bus-business-trip-price-300x140.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p>A local company is attending a conference at <a href="http://www.wsanfrancisco.com/">The W Hotel</a> in San Francisco. A total of about 20 employees will be taking part. They plan to leave their office in <a href="http://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/fremont-charter-bus">Fremont</a> at 10am on Friday, May 11th and return at 6pm on Sunday, May 13th. While they’re at the convention, they’ll use their bus to help them travel to restaurants and other attractions between events.</p>
