				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you’re visiting <a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/">San Francisco</a> or you live in the Bay Area, one thing’s for sure: spring and summer are great times to be in the city. In the spring, the weather is mild and clear, and it’s off-season for the tourists. Summer sees an influx of tourists, but longer days mean you have time to see everything on your bucket list.</p>
<p>It won’t be hard to find something fun to do with the plethora of outdoor events to attend in the Bay Area between the months of March and September. To help you and your group plan the perfect itinerary in San Francisco, our team at San Francisco Charter Bus Company have come up with a list of our favorite, can&#8217;t-miss events in the area.</p>

<p><strong>Bus Tip:</strong> Want to pregame before the film festival? Keep the party going all the way to there by opting for a shared ride experience with San Francisco Charter Bus Company. The <a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/buses">charter buses</a> in our network can carry anywhere from 18-56 people. In most cases, you can even drink on the bus on the way there—just clarify with our reservation specialists ahead of time that you’d like to bring alcohol.</p>
<h2>San Francisco International Beer Festival</h2>
<p><strong>What:</strong> The <a href="https://www.sfbeerfest.com/">San Francisco International Beer Festival</a> is the Bay Area’s oldest beer festival with over 100 brewers, live music, complementary bites, games, and (of course) great-tasting beer.</p>

<p><strong>Insider Tip:</strong> People who <a href="https://www.sfbeerfest.com/volunteer">volunteer</a> at the event will not only feel great about supporting kids in the community, but they’ll also get a T-shirt and their first beverage at the after-party for free.</p>
<p><strong>Bus Tip:</strong> Let’s face it… after drinking for three hours, you might have a little trouble getting home trying to call an Uber or taking public transportation.

<p><strong>Bus Tip:</strong> Due to lack of parking options, it is not recommended to drive your own car to the event. Taking a charter bus with your group will help you arrive relaxed and ready to celebrate. Your driver will take care of all of the details, so you can sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride to Carnaval San Francisco.</p>
<h2>Clusterfest Comedy Festival</h2>
<p><strong>What:</strong> Comedy, podcasts and drag queens&#8230;oh my! Are you and your crew ready to have a night you won’t forget? Then <a href="https://www.clusterfest.com/">Clusterfest</a> is the event for you. Taking place over the course of a three-day weekend, you’ll be entertained by more than 50 acts on five stages celebrating all things comedy.</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong> Civic Center Plaza, 335 McAllister St, San Francisco, CA 94102 and the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium, 99 Grove St, San Francisco, CA 94102</p>

<p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Past acts have included the hosts of the hit podcast, My Favorite Murder, standup comedian John Mulaney, former Brooklyn Nine-Nine star Chelsea Peretti and one of the stars of Netflix’s Queer Eye, Jonathan Van Ness.</p>
<p><strong>Insider Tip:</strong> There are a list of <a href="https://www.clusterfest.com/info/">items you aren’t allowed to bring</a> into the festival, including mesh bags, alcohol, cameras, selfie sticks, coolers, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Bus Tip:</strong> Parking in the area is tough, and if you’re attending the comedy festival with a group of your closest friends or extended family, why worry about coordinating multiple Ubers? With a charter bus, you’ll all be able to arrive at the same time and walk in together.</p>
<h2>Outside Lands</h2>

<p><strong>Bus Tip:</strong> Outside Lands recommends rideshares, scooters or bikes to get to Golden Gate Park due to limited parking.
