<p><u><a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/">San Francisco</a></u> is one of the most popular cities in California and is on many travelers’ bucket lists of top places to visit from around the world. A compact city of steep rolling hills surrounded by water on three sides, San Francisco is renowned for its summer fog, Victorian architecture, cable cars, and towering vistas. Additionally, this Bay Area city hosts many iconic outdoor attractions that are perfect stops for tour groups who love the outdoors. There are a series of captivating views at every turn in this wild and windy city. From hiking trails around timeless city marvels to natural features in its coastal plains, vast ocean, and lush forests, the city has something for everyone.</p>
<p>San Francisco Charter Bus Company has experience in servicing all types of group trips in the San Francisco area. We’ll guide you through our simple booking process for events of every kind, allowing trip planners to quickly rent buses for <u><a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/private-bus-transportation">private outings</a></u>, <u><a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/corporate-bus-rental">corporate events</a></u>, <u><a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/wedding-bus-rental">wedding celebrations</a></u>, <u><a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/school-event-bus-rental">school field trips</a></u>, and more. Take to the streets on your schedule!</p>
<h2>How to Get Around the Bay Area By Bus</h2>
<p>When you’re traveling through golden attractions and over bridges, consider taking a private shuttle instead of Uber or Lyft. Your driver can take you to any sites and attractions in or outside of the city, making you only a ride away from the most breathtaking views of the Bay. Though trains, subways, buses, ferries, and railways are also functional for short direct trips, they are not the quickest travel solution due to their long lines and unpredictable travel schedules. If you are arriving in a nearby city and plan to make your way to the Bay on your next trip to San Francisco, we recommend you take a <u><a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/buses">San Francisco charter bus</a></u> through the best routes in town. A private bus can whisk your group to top travel destinations with ease, while you relax and enjoy every step of the way through California’s most beloved port city.</p>
<h2>Travel Comfortably to Outdoor Activities in the Bay</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-138" src="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/social-media-vacation.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="350" srcset="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/social-media-vacation.jpg 750w, https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/social-media-vacation-300x140.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p>The most important step in planning your trip is choosing the right bus model for you. Outdoor trips can take weeks, sometimes months on the road before arriving at your destination, so ensure you’ll be traveling comfortably on your journey. For smaller groups, we offer a wide selection of <u><a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/20-passenger-minibus-rental">minibus models</a></u> holding up to <u><a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/25-passenger-minibus-rental">25 passengers</a></u>. The<u><a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/56-passenger-charter-bus-rental"> 56-passenger</a></u> model, however, is our most-used charter bus for larger groups of students and volunteers due to its spaciousness.</p>
<p>If you’re traveling for more than a few days, we recommend investing in a full-sized coach. Each model can come with modern luxury features such as climate-controlled interiors, cushioned reclining seats, overhead storage, and luggage bays beneath the bus. If you’re traveling for business or school, you’ll want to use our on-board WiFi, power outlets, and flat-screen TVs with DVD players to keep passengers entertained as they bond along the way. Whether you’re planning an all-day shuttle service or a week-long road trip to a neighboring town, comfortable amenities make it easy to keep your group comfortable and relaxed as you travel together. We’ll make sure you’re paired with a reliable ride to make the event run smoothly!</p>

<p><u><a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/">San Francisco</a></u>, California has its fair share of spellbinding views, historic churches, wineries, and vineyards perfect for an adventurous bride and groom. The City by the Bay is home to the largest collection of American wines in the world, so it’s no surprise that couples line up to plan their dream wedding at one of its enchanting sites, vineyards, and wineries. While a wedding venue unites two members in a loving partnership, it also welcomes and brings together families big and small along with the extended community. Traveling with large parties can present many challenges that make staying together a chore. To avoid the airport and public transit hassles, make sure you choose a <u><a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/buses">wedding shuttle</a></u> equipped to accommodate your entire party from pickup at the hotel to drop off at the venue.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-128" src="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/san-fran-wedding-decor-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="350" srcset="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/san-fran-wedding-decor-1-1.jpg 750w, https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/san-fran-wedding-decor-1-1-300x140.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p>SF Charter Bus Company will help organize the ceremony with elegant transportation, so you can focus on what’s important: your special day. From the bachelorette and bachelor party to the wedding ceremony and reception, San Francisco Charter Bus Company will give you one less item for a planner to worry about. We can pair you with a sleek and modern full-sized coach rental for the wedding ceremony and reception, or even a minibus to transport smaller groups around town for the bachelor or bachelorette party. Each wedding shuttle can also be decorated to match the theme of your wedding, making the trip more personalized for your guests. If your group plans to wine and dine as they venue hop, your driver can double as a designated driver so everyone in your bachelor or bachelorette trip will be worry-free!</p>
<p>There are a few types of wedding shuttles to choose from, which include an <u><a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/18-passenger-minibus-rental">18-passenger</a></u> minibus, <u><a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/20-passenger-minibus-rental">20-passenger</a></u> minibus, or a <u><a href="https://www.sanfranciscobuschartercompany.com/56-passenger-charter-bus-rental">56-passenger</a></u> charter bus. When traveling with a small group of fewer than 25 guests, your best option may be to invest in a minibus rental so that you are not left with more seats than people. For a large wedding party of 25 to 56 passengers, you may want to rent a full-sized charter bus to get more seats at a more affordable rate.</p>
