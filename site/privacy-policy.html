                    <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
                    <p>"Cookies" are small text files that are stored on your browser or device by websites, apps, online media, and advertisements. There are different types of cookies. Cookies served by the entity that operates the domain you are visiting are called “first party cookies.” Cookies served by companies that are not operating the domain you’re visiting are called “third party cookies.” For example, if we allow Google to set a cookie on your browser while you visit our website, it would be a third party cookie. Cookies may also endure for different periods of time. “Session Cookies” only last as long as your browser is open. They are deleted automatically once you close your browser. Other cookies are “persistent cookies” meaning that they survive after your browser is closed. For example, they may recognize your device when you re-open your browser.</p>
                    <p>Other Identification Technologies we may use include, "Pixel tags” (also called beacons or pixels), which are small blocks of code installed on (or called by) a webpage, app, or advertisement which can retrieve certain information about your device and browser, including for example: device type, operating system, browser type and version, website visited, time of visit, referring website, IP address, and other similar information, including the small text file (the cookie) that uniquely identifies the device. Pixels provide the means by which third parties can set and read browser cookies from a domain that they do not themselves operate and collect information about visitors to that domain, typically with the permission of the domain owner. “Local storage” refers generally to other places on a browser or device where information can be stored by websites, ads, or third parties (such as HTML5 local storage and browser cache).</p>

                    <p><strong>Types of Cookies We Use</strong></p>
                    <p>We may use a number of different types of cookies in providing the Services, as outlined below:</p>
                    <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
                        <li>
                            <p>Authentication Cookies - tell us when you’re logged in, so we can show you the appropriate experience and features such as your account information, trip history, and to edit your account settings.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Security and Site Integrity Cookies - support or enable security features to help keep DHarris Tours safe and secure. For example, they enable us to remember when you are logged into a secure area of the Services and help protect your account from being accessed by anyone other than you.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Localization - helps DHarris Tours provide a localized experience. For example, we may store information in a cookie that is placed on your browser or device so you will see the site in your preferred language.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Site Features and Services - provide functionality that helps us deliver products and Services. For example, cookies help you log in by pre-filling fields. We may also use cookies and similar technologies to help us provide you and others with social plugins and other customized content and experiences, such as making suggestions to you and others.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Analytics and Research - used to understand, improve, and research products and Services, including when you access the DHarris Tours website and related websites and apps from a computer or mobile device. For example, we may use cookies to understand how you are using site features, and segmenting audiences for feature testing. We and our partners may use these technologies and the information we receive to improve and understand how you use websites, apps, products, services and ads.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Advertising - used to deliver relevant ads, track ad campaign performance and efficiency. For example, we and our ad partners may rely on information gleaned through these cookies to serve you ads that may be interesting to you on other websites. Similarly, our partners may use a cookie, attribution service or another similar technology to determine whether we’ve served an ad and how it performed or provide us with information about how you interact with them. For more information about interest-based ads, or to opt out of having your web-browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes, please visit www.aboutads.info/choices if you are in the United States.</p>

                    <p><strong>Your Choices</strong></p>
                    <p>You have the right to choose whether or not to accept cookies. However, they are an important part of how our Services work, so you should be aware that if you choose to refuse or remove cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of the Services. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. To do so, please follow the instructions provided by your browser which are usually located within the "Help" or “Preferences” menu. Some third parties also provide the ability to refuse their cookies directly by clicking on an opt-out link. Removing or rejecting browser cookies does not necessarily affect third-party flash cookies, which may be used by us or our partners in connection with our Services.</p>
