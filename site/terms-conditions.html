    </div>
    <div class="content-section">
        <div class="container">
            <p class="margin-top-quarter">This Service Terms and Agreement for Transportation Reservations (the “Agreement”) is by and between DHarris Tours LLC (“DHarris Tours”) and you (either individually or on behalf of any entity whom you are representing)(“Client” or “you”).</p>
            <p class="margin-top-quarter">This Agreement governs your procurement of bus charter services (the "Charter Services"). </p>
            <p class="margin-top-quarter">BY CLICKING “I AGREE”, MAKING A RESERVATION, UTILIZING THE CHARTER SERVICES, OR OTHERWISE SIGNIFYING YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT (A) YOU ARE AUTHORIZED TO ENTER THIS AGREEMENT FOR AND ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF AND, IF APPLICABLE, YOUR ORGANIZATION, AND ARE DOING SO, (B) YOU AND YOUR ORGANIZATION CAN LEGALLY ENTER INTO THESE TERMS AND (C) YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU AND THE ORGANIZATION SHALL BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.</p>
			<p class="margin-top-quarter">You agree that you are fully responsible for the actions of all of you, your passengers, guests and invitees (collectively, the “Passengers”) aboard the buses provided through DHarris Tours (the “Service Buses”).</p>
            
			<h4 class="margin-top-quarter">1. RESERVATIONS AND DEPOSIT</h4>
			<p class="margin-top-quarter">Reservations for Charter Services may be made electronically through DHarris Tours’ website – www.dharristours.com (the “Website”) or by phone. Until the reservation is confirmed by DHarris Tours in writing (including by email) the reservation is subject to change by DHarris Tours, or you.</p>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">You understand and agree that payment for all charter services reserved through DHarris Tours shall be made payable to, and collected by, DHarris Tours LLC.</p>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">DHarris Tours is not responsible for any confirmation of your reservations that is lost or otherwise not received when booking via the internet. If your spam blocker is on, a confirmation may not get through. It is your responsibility to call and get a confirmation email when making a booking.</p>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">All reservations that are more than fourteen (14) days from the scheduled date of service (the “Date of Service”) require a deposit of at least ten (10) percent. DHarris Tours shall confirm the amount of the deposit at the time Client makes its reservation. Full payment is required within 14 days of the reservation. </p>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">Client may change a reservation subject to (a) the availability of the requested Charter Services as proposed by the changed reservation, (b) payment of the applicable fee as determined by DHarris Tours in its sole discretion.</p>

			<h4 class="margin-top-quarter">2. CANCELLATIONS AND REFUND POLICY</h4>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">(a) Any cancellation made within fourteen (14) days of the pickup date will result in a charge equal to 100% of the contracted for amount.  All deposits and other payments are non-refundable within 14 days of the pickup date.</p>
			
			<p class="margin-top-quarter">In certain specific circumstances, DHarris Tours may in its sole discretion refund some or all of a deposit or the Estimated Costs that have been paid by you if the Charter Service Bus breaks down or breaches its obligations under this Agreement to provide the Charter Services (a “Performance Failure”). Any such Performance Failure shall not affect, and there shall be no refunds of any sort, in connection with any Service Buses not affected by a Performance Failure that you may have charted for Charter Services under this Agreement. You shall remain fully responsible and liable for all deposits, the Estimated Costs and all other amounts due under this Agreement for any such other Service Buses and Charter Services in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.</p>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">(b) If you want to cancel your reservation, you shall send written notice to: support@dharristours.com</p>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">(c) You agree to pay any cancellation or change fees that you incur. Any charge associated with a cancellation is final and not transferable to future or alternative services.</p>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">(d) If the driver arrives at the scheduled pick-up location and Client is not there, and we’re unable to locate or contact the contact person within 60 minutes of the scheduled pick- up time, by the means provided in the reservation, then the ride will be considered a no-show and the reservation cancelled. You shall be fully liable for 100% of the Estimated Cost.</p>

			<h4 class="margin-top-quarter">3. RATES AND PAYMENT</h4>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">(a) All advertised rates are subject to change without notice and may be increased at any time prior to confirmation by DHarris Tours in its sole discretion.</p>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">(b) The rate quoted for the Charter Services is an estimate based on the information that you provided to DHarris Tours in connection with your reservation. There may be additional charges including for taxes, credit card processing fees, damage to the buses, injury to the driver, overtime (i.e., exceeding the time of your reservation), traveling further than originally requested and clean-up that requires a greater than normal amount of time and material necessary to clean the buses properly (“Excessive Cleaning”). The fee for Excessive Cleaning shall be determined by DHarris Tours in its sole discretion but the minimum fee is $250.</p>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">(c) You hereby authorize DHarris Tours to initiate entries to your check/savings account and/or credit card at the financial institution provided by you at the time of reservation, and, if necessary, initiate adjustments for any transactions credited or debited in error or additional charges. This authority remains in effect until DHarris Tours is notified in writing to cancel it. To cancel such authority, you shall provide written notice to DHarris Tours no less than thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of such cancellation. DHarris Tours may attempt multiple smaller transactions if your financial institution declines large transaction attempts.</p>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">(d) You agree that if any attempt to charge a credit or debit card is declined at any time, then DHarris Tours may terminate the option to pay by credit or debit card. If DHarris Tours terminates this option, then all remaining payments shall be made via check or electronic wire transfer. If you refuse to pay the remaining balance via check or wire then your reservation(s) will be cancelled and you will be subject to the cancellation charges set forth in Section 2.</p>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">You agree that DHarris Tours shall ask, at it's discretion, for all total payments exceeding $5,000 to be made via check or electronic wire transfer. Refusing to pay via check or electronic wire transfer does not nullify this agreement and shall not relieve you of cancellation charges as set forth in Section 2.</p>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">(e) You agree not to dispute any fees or charges in connection with the Charter Services that were otherwise made consistent with the terms of this Agreement, including cancellation fees, warranties, dispute resolution, the Waived Conditions and any other risks for which DHarris Tours has disclaimed responsibility or any claims that you have waived (the “Improperly Disputed Amounts”). If you dispute any such fees or charges, then DHarris Tours shall have the right to charge you, and you shall pay, any related fees charged by any financial institution involved with the dispute, any attorneys' fees and expenses and court or arbitration costs associated with enforcing and collecting payment any such fees or charges and any other damages suffered by DHarris Tours related to or arising from the Improperly Disputed Amounts.</p>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">(f) It is a violation of law to place a reservation in a false name or with an invalid credit card number with the intent to defraud. Please be aware that even if you do not give DHarris Tours your real name, your Web browser transmits a unique Internet address to us that can be used by law enforcement officials to identify you. Fraudulent users will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Accordingly, if you knowingly input false information in a reservation form, including someone else’s name, e-mail, address, physical address, phone number, random or made up name, address, e-mail, or phone number, you agree to fully indemnify and be liable to DHarris Tours and its affiliate companies, for an amount of $10,000 to each company involved, plus any attorneys' fees and expenses and court or arbitration costs.</p>


			<h4 class="margin-top-quarter">4. OVERTIME AND ADDITIONAL CHARGES</h4>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">(a) Client shall be fully responsible for any overtime incurred. Overtime will be charged at a rate determined by DHarris Tours in its sole discretion and is incurred in hourly increments (plus additional taxes and fees). DHarris Tours cannot guarantee the availability of overtime. It is of particular importance then that you make allowances for anticipated delays and adhere to the agreed time schedule.</p>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">Time and charges begin when the Service Bus arrives at the pick-up location. If there is an error in the stated address, you shall be charged for the time needed to reroute the Service Bus to a different address.</p>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">(b) You agree to pay the following additional expenses incurred in connection with Charter Services: (i) driver's lodging, (ii) tolls, (iii) parking fees (iv) additional stops and (v) any other expenses incurred in connection with the provision of the Charter Services.</p>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">You agree that if required, you will arrange for appropriate lodging for drivers that meet or exceed the following minimum standards: 2.5 star or better hotel/motel, private room with private shower and bathroom. If you fail to provide the driver(s) with private lodging meeting the above listed requirements, you (i) authorize DHarris Tours to procure such alternative lodging for the driver(s) and (ii) agree to reimburse DHarris Tours for the cost of any such alternative lodging.</p>

			<h4 class="margin-top-quarter">5. CHARTER SERVICES</h4>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">(a) Images of, and information regarding, buses and other vehicles presented on the Website may differ from the actual Service Buses.</p>

                </li>
			</ol>    
			<p class="margin-top-quarter">You acknowledge and agree that DHarris Tours does not guarantee the Waived Conditions and you specifically waive any claims against DHarris Tours or right to terminate this Agreement or demand any refund from DHarris Tours related to or in connection with the Waived Conditions. At DHarris Tours’ sole discretion, DHarris Tours may provide limited assistance in resolving claims against a Carrier when such claims are presented before trip end.  With respect to any Interference Event, DHarris Tours use commercially reasonable efforts to get the Service Bus operating again or to obtain a replacement bus as soon as possible.</p>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">(c) You acknowledge and agree that Service Buses and their drivers may not arrive on time for pickup, and may deliver Passengers later than their original scheduled arrival time. You specifically waive any claims against DHarris Tours to terminate this Agreement or any sort of refund if the Service Bus is delayed due to events of Force Majeure, including GPS malfunctions, GPS signal problems incorrect route information on the GPS, road closures, or traffic delays. In addition, you acknowledge and agree that certain road and vehicle conditions may require the Service Bus to travel slower than usual. The speed at which to travel, the route and any other trip related decisions shall be solely determined by the driver in his sole discretion.</p>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">(d) Unless agreed to in writing at the time of the reservation, DHarris Tours is not obligated to provide options for buses or drivers that are SPAB certified / school certified, DOD certified, or require special permits or certificates. Cancellation for such reasons shall not relieve you of cancellation charges as set forth in Section 2.</p>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">(e) You agree that a reasonable number of seats on the Service Bus may be reserved to allow any required additional drivers or support staff to travel on the Service Bus.</p>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">(f) DHarris Tours shall not be responsible for any lost or damaged items. DHarris Tours reserves the right to charge a fee for returning any items found in the Service Buses.</p>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">(g) DHarris Tours or the driver may terminate any trip without refund in its sole discretion, if (i) the driver or the dispatcher on duty feels that you or any of the Passengers are putting the driver, the Service Bus or any of the Passengers in danger or harm or (ii) you and/or any of the Passengers are in possession of any illegal material and/or substance. This is without exception.</p>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">(h) Drivers must follow FMCSA Hours of Service Regulations and other applicable regulations and shall not agree to any request to exceed the regulated FMCSA Hours of Service or to violate any other regulations. These regulations restrict driving time to ten (10) hours and duty time to fifteen (15) hours. Unless agreed to in writing at the time of the reservation, we’re not obligated to arrange buses with more than one driver on each bus. Drivers are entitled to a hotel room in accordance with Section 4(b) no later than when they reach these restrictions on driving and/or duty times. We may terminate any trip without refund in its sole discretion if you or any of the Passengers attempt to force the driver to exceed regulated FMCSA Hours of Service or to violate any other applicable regulations. Additional detail can be found on the FMCSA website: https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/regulations/hours-service/summary-hours-service-regulations.</p>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">(i)	You, or such representative designated by you, agree that as requested by the Driver, you will input such requested information into the DHarris Tours application utilized by the Driver on a mobile device for the purpose of confirming the trip and the completion thereof.</p>

These limitations shall apply notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of any limited remedy.</p>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">(d) You acknowledge and agree that DHarris Tours is severally, providing the DHarris Tours portal and services and Charter Services, respectively, and other services, sets prices, and entered into this Agreement in reliance upon the warranty disclaimers and the limitations of liability set forth herein, that the warranty disclaimers and the limitations of liability set forth herein reflect a reasonable and fair allocation of risk between you and DHarris Tours, and that the warranty disclaimers and the limitations of liability set forth herein form an essential basis of the bargain between you and DHarris Tours. DHarris Tours would not be able to provide the Charter Services to you on an economically reasonable basis without these limitations.</p>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">(e) DHarris Tours shall be liable for any delay or failure in its performance of any of the acts required by this Agreement or the Charter Services, when such delay or failure arises from circumstances beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of such party (“Force Majeure”). Such causes may include, without limitation, traffic, mechanical breakdowns, road conditions, acts of local, state or national governments or public agencies, acts of public enemies, acts of civil or military authority, labor disputes, utility or communication failures or delays, earthquakes, fire, flood, other natural disasters, epidemics, riots or strikes. The time for performance of any act delayed by any such event may be postponed for a period equal to the period of such delay.</p>

			<h4 class="margin-top-quarter">7. LICENSE</h4>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">(a) In situations where You engage DHarris Tours to provide Charter Services to an event (each, an “Event”) You own or are directly hosting or sponsoring, You hereby grant to DHarris Tours a perpetual, fully paid, non-exclusive, and royalty-free license to utilize Your trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, marks or other business identifiers related to such Event (collectively, the “Marks”) within the scope of license (the “Scope”) defined in Section 7(c) below. </p>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">(b) In situations where You engage DHarris Tours to reserve and/or pay for Charter Services to an Event that is owned, hosted or sponsored by a third party, You covenant, warrant and agree to obtain from such third party a perpetual, fully paid, non-exclusive, and royalty-free license to utilize such third party’s trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, marks or other business identifiers related to such Event (collectively, the “Third Party Marks”) within the scope of license (the “Scope”) defined below.</p>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">(c) For the purposes of this Agreement, the “Scope” shall mean DHarris Tours’ use of the Marks or Third Party Marks, as the case may be, to advertise and promote DHarris Tours’ Charter Services by publicizing the fact that DHarris Tours has provided such Charter Services to or on behalf of such Event.</p>

			<h4 class="margin-top-quarter">8. INDEMNIFICATION</h4>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">You shall indemnify and hold harmless DHarris Tours, and each of its officers, directors, agents, contractors, subcontractors, licensees and employees (collectively referred to as the “DHarris Tours Indemnitees”), and each of them, against and from any and all third party allegations, demands, claims, liabilities, damages, fines, penalties or costs of whatever nature (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), and whether by reason of death of or injury to any person or loss of or damage to any property or otherwise, (“DHarris Tours Claims”), arising out of or in any way connected with (a) any actual or alleged violation or breach by you (including any of your employees. contractors or passengers) of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (b) violation of any law, rule or regulation, (c) use of the Website by you (including any of your employees or contractors) on behalf of yourself or any third party, (d) any failure to procure the license rights contemplated under Section 7(b) above, and (e) the acts or omissions of you (including any of your employees and contractors). If any DHarris Tours Claim is made or any action or proceeding is brought against DHarris Tours Indemnitees, or any of them, any such DHarris Tours Indemnitee may, by notice to you, require you, at your expense, to resist such DHarris Tours Claim or take over the defense of any such action or proceeding and employ counsel for such purpose, such counsel to be subject to the prior approval of such DHarris Tours Indemnitee. Your reimbursement, indemnity and contribution obligations under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability that you may otherwise have, and shall extend upon the same terms and conditions to DHarris Tours Indemnitees.</p>
			<p class="margin-top-quarter">You and DHarris Tours agree that any dispute, claim or controversy at law or equity that arises out of this Agreement or the Charter Services (a “Claim”) will be resolved in accordance with this Section 8 or as DHarris Tours and you otherwise agree in writing.</p>


			<h4 class="margin-top-quarter">9. GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION.</h4>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">(a) Choice of Law. This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of Georgia, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION, PROCEEDING, CAUSE OF ACTION OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY CLAIM OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE CHARTER SERVICES.</p>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">(b) Arbitration and Class Action Waiver.
			PLEASE REVIEW AS THIS AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.</p>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">(i) Arbitration. YOU AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS BETWEEN YOU AND DHarris CHARTERS (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH CLAIM INVOLVES A THIRD PARTY) IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE CHARTER SERVICES WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION UNDER THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION'S RULES FOR ARBITRATION OF CONSUMER-RELATED DISPUTES IN FULTON COUNTY, GEORGIA. YOU AND DHarris CHARTERS HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY. DISCOVERY AND RIGHTS TO APPEAL IN ARBITRATION ARE GENERALLY MORE LIMITED THAN IN A LAWSUIT, AND OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU AND DHarris CHARTERS WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.
			</p>
			<p class="margin-top-quarter">
			Neither you nor DHarris Tours will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement to arbitrate.</p>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY CLASS CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST DHarris CHARTERS INCLUDING ANY RIGHT TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS.</p>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if DHarris Tours is a party to the proceeding.</p>
			<p class="margin-top-quarter">This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not by any state law concerning arbitration. In the event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either DHarris Tours or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms.</p>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">(ii) Judicial Forum for Disputes. In the event that the agreement to arbitrate under this Section 8(b) is found not to apply to you or your claim, you and DHarris Tours agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) must be brought, solely and exclusively in, and will be subject to the service of process and other applicable procedural rules of, the federal or state courts of Fulton County, Georgia. Both you and DHarris Tours consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there. Notwithstanding the foregoing, DHarris Tours may bring a claim for equitable relief in any court with proper jurisdiction.</p>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">(iii) This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of this Agreement or your relationship with DHarris Tours.</p>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">(c) Improperly Filed Claims. All claims you bring against DHarris Tours must be resolved in accordance with this Section 8. All claims filed or brought contrary to this Section 8 shall be considered improperly filed. Should you file a claim contrary to this Section 8, DHarris Tours may recover attorneys’ fees and costs up to $15,000, provided that DHarris Tours has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.</p>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">(d) Limitation on Time to File Claims. Any cause of action or claim you may have arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Charter Services must be commenced within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues, otherwise, such cause of action or claim is permanently barred.</p>


			<h4 class="margin-top-quarter">10. Non-Disparagement.</h4>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">You agree to take no action which is intended, or would reasonably be expected, to harm the Company or its or their reputation or which would reasonably be expected to lead to unwanted or unfavorable publicity to the Company.</p>
			<p class="margin-top-quarter">Should you take action intended, or would reasonably be expected, to harm the reputation of DHarris Tours, DHarris Tours may recover attorneys’ fees and costs up to $20,000.</p>

			<h4 class="margin-top-quarter">11. Miscellaneous.</h4>
			<p class="margin-top-quarter">(a) In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be adjudged illegal or otherwise unenforceable, such provision shall be severed and the balance of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</p>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">(b) The waiver by DHarris Tours of any breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other breach</p>

			<p class="margin-top-quarter">(c) All notices pursuant to this Agreement to either party shall be in writing and shall be personally delivered or mailed by overnight courier, or transmitted electronically, fees prepaid. Notice shall be deemed given and effective on receipt by the party to whom such notice is directed.</p>
