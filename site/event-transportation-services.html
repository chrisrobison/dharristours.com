            <h2>Why Choose DHarris Tours?</h2>

<p>DHarris Tours works with certified, experienced drivers and matches each client with a&nbsp;<u><a href="https://dharristours.com/site/buses.html">bus rental</a></u> tailored to their needs. We communicate with experts in the field to ensure that each coach meets the safety standards of the industry. Our company mission is to ensure each passenger arrives at their destination safely and comfortably. Your professional driver will be experienced in managing the trip navigation schedule around traffic before dropping you off on time at your location. Planners can rely on DHarris Tours for streamlined transportation&nbsp;and shuttle services for events of all types at any location&nbsp;in the U.S.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Corporate Affairs Transportation Made Easy</h2>

<p>Planning&nbsp;ground transportation for corporate events can be challenging. With limited parking at corporate venues and high traffic in urban areas, travel options can be limited. Expand your travel range with a transportation method that can cover the full scope of the trip, so important clientele can be transported, picked up, and shuttled to anywhere in the city.</p>

<p>While planning an event, no one wants to worry about whether guests will arrive prepped and on-time to important industry events, seminars, or award ceremonies, especially when you&rsquo;ve spent time planning it! Instead, arrange for a shuttle service to transport guests to and from their hotels or parking spots so you can rest assured everyone will have a safe ride all night, even if they&rsquo;re unfamiliar with the area. We&rsquo;ll help you choose your travel method based on the number of guests, length of your trip, and travel destination.</p>

<h2>Wedding Event Planning Simplified By Bus</h2>

<p>Anyone who has ever planned a wedding knows to budget for the venue, catering, and decor. Why? Because attention to detail aides in the creation of a fairytale dream wedding. When planning a wedding, the saying truly does ring true that &ldquo;preparation equals success.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With all these special elements in place, don&rsquo;t overlook the importance of wedding travel. We provide a wedding shuttle service that can scale to your budget while providing event shuttles with luxurious, cutting-edge amenities so you can bus your special guests in comfort throughout the entire event. We work closely with wedding planners to learn how to harness your wedding transportation seamlessly--&nbsp; reach out to DHarris Tours to start planning your wedding event.</p>

<h2>School Field Trip Transportation &amp; Shuttles</h2>

<p>Looking to take a school field trip, but not sure how to cut costs? An affordable option when exploring a new city is actually renting with a larger travel group. But are tour buses really the best option when the planned field trip event asks you to meet them at a certain time and destination? Bus tours tend to cost a fortune and typically last the length of several hours, which gets in the way of important field trip plans.</p>

<p>A personal bus driver will be able to quickly drop your school group off at their destination and round all passengers up at your chosen time. With your own private rental, you will be able to store your belongings in the luggage bays safely and securely as you are chauffeured from your school to every educational destination on your itinerary.</p>

<h2>Sports Event Shuttle Bus &amp; Minibus Rentals</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re planning a sports event bus rental to transport your fans or sports team on game day, you can gather your group together in a simple, classic rideshare! We&rsquo;ll coordinate your friends, family, colleagues, and teammates in a comfortable private ride. Whether you&rsquo;re traveling for a home or far away game, we&rsquo;ll provide you with a full-sized motorcoach fully equipped with comfortable amenities, such as televisions, Wi-Fi, restrooms, and reclining adjustable seating. All you have to do is request these amenities with your reservation specialist and we&#39;ll do our best to find a bus&nbsp;that checks all your boxes.</p>

<p>Our bus selection includes minibuses, charter buses, and full-sized coaches. Depending on the size of your team, you can rent out sizable minibuses that hold anywhere from <u><a href="https://dharristours.com/site/18-passenger-minibus">18-passengers</a></u> to <u><a href="https://dharristours.com/site/25-passenger-minibus">25-passengers</a></u>, or invest in a full-sized <u><a href="https://dharristours.com/site/36-56-passenger-van-hool-bus">36 to 56-passenger</a></u> motorcoach rental.</p>

<h2>Family Reunions &amp; Group Event Travel&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The holidays are a magical season meant to be shared with friends and family. But with group planning involved, transportation can get a bit tricky as you try to coordinate times, stay organized, and figure out the most affordable and reliable transportation method for short- or long-distance reunions. By consolidating your group into one vehicle, you can streamline your family reunion&rsquo;s plans for schedules and event parking while saving time and money.</p>

<p>Regardless of the travel distance, a private shuttle will make it easy to transport your entire group to and from lodging. This way, you can ensure everyone is able to spend the holidays together without ripping a hole in their wallet from taking separate caravans to the same destination. Book your family travel method with us and we will pair your group with the perfect model for you.</p>
